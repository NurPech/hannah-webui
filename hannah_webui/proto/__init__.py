# Generated gRPC stubs — do not edit the *_pb2*.py files manually.
# Re-generate with:
#   bash scripts/gen_proto.sh   (from repo root)
#
# hannah.proto was split by scope into multiple .proto files (synced from Core, which
# did the same split under gessinger/voice/hannah#44). protoc's Python codegen keeps
# each file's messages/enums in that file's own generated module (control_pb2,
# user_registry_pb2, ...) rather than re-exporting them into hannah_pb2 — but existing
# code across this repo does `from hannah_webui.proto import hannah_pb2` and expects
# every message (hannah_pb2.Car, hannah_pb2.User, ...) to be reachable there, same as
# before the split. Patch every scope module's public names onto hannah_pb2 here so
# that keeps working without touching dozens of call sites in app.py/grpc_client.py.
